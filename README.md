# OCPI-go

Welcome ðŸ‘‹

This repository contains client libraries for OCPI (Open Charge Point Interface) protocol.
Every OCPI version has its own OpenAPI specification that is used to generate the client using `oapi-codegen` generator.
For more detailed documentation about the OCPI protocol and its APIs please read the
official [OCPI documentation](https://evroaming.org/app/uploads/2021/11/OCPI-2.2.1.pdf)

## Generation

This code base was generated using [oapi-codegen](https://github.com/deepmap/oapi-codegen).

after creating or adjusting the OpenAPI specification. Please do not modify the clients, running
generation will overwrite them.
